## What are formatting options?

When you generate a draft in Scripture Forge, you can select formatting options that control how the draft text is structured and presented. These options help ensure that the generated draft matches your project's formatting needs and conventions.

## First-time setup

The first time you generate a draft for your project, you will be required to select formatting options. This is a necessary step to ensure the draft is generated according to your project's requirements.

Once you've selected formatting options for the first time, Scripture Forge will remember your selections. The same formatting options will be used automatically for all future drafts, so you won't need to configure these settings again.

## Changing formatting options

While your initial formatting selections are saved and reused automatically, you can choose different options at any time when generating a new draft. This allows you to adjust the formatting if your project's needs change or if you want to experiment with different settings.

## Understanding the options

The formatting options control various aspects of how the draft text is structured, including:

- How verses and paragraphs are formatted
- How special text elements like poetry, lists, or quotations are handled  
- What punctuation and spacing conventions are applied
- How section headings and other structural elements are formatted

The specific options available will depend on your project type and the source texts you are translating from. During the draft generation process, you'll be presented with the available options and can select the ones that best fit your project.

## Best practices

When selecting formatting options:

- **Review the defaults**: The default options are chosen to work well for most projects
- **Think about your workflow**: Consider how the draft will be used and edited by your team
- **Be consistent**: Using the same formatting options for all drafts in your project helps maintain consistency
- **Ask for help if needed**: If you're unsure which options to choose, contact the Scripture Forge support team or your translation consultant

Remember that you can always change the formatting options for future drafts if you find that different settings work better for your project.

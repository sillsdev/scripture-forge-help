## Introduction

When you generate a draft in Scripture Forge for the first time, you will need to select formatting options that control how the draft is generated. These formatting options determine how the AI model processes and outputs the translated text.

## First-time setup

The first time you generate a draft for your project, you will be prompted to select formatting options. These options are required to ensure the draft is generated according to your project's needs and preferences.

Once you've selected formatting options for the first time, Scripture Forge will remember your selections and automatically use the same options for future drafts. This means you won't need to configure these settings each time you generate a new draft.

## Changing formatting options

While your initial formatting selections are saved and reused automatically, you can change these options at any time when generating a new draft. This flexibility allows you to experiment with different settings or adjust the formatting as your project needs evolve.

To change the formatting options for a new draft:

1. Navigate to the **Generate draft** page
2. Click on the option to configure or change formatting settings
3. Select your preferred formatting options
4. Continue with the draft generation process

## Available formatting options

Scripture Forge provides several formatting options to customize how your draft is generated:

### Text formatting

These options control how the text is structured and formatted in the output:

- **Verse numbering**: Choose how verse numbers are displayed in the draft (inline, separate, or omitted)
- **Paragraph breaks**: Control how paragraph breaks from the source text are preserved or adapted in the draft
- **Poetry formatting**: Determine how poetic passages are formatted to maintain their structure

### Punctuation and typography

These settings manage punctuation and typographic elements:

- **Quotation marks**: Select the style of quotation marks used in the draft (straight quotes, curly quotes, or language-specific markers)
- **Punctuation adaptation**: Choose whether punctuation from the source text should be adapted to match the target language conventions

### Special text handling

Options for handling specific types of biblical text:

- **Section headings**: Decide whether section headings should be included or translated in the draft
- **Cross-references and footnotes**: Control how cross-references and footnotes are handled during draft generation
- **Divine names**: Configure how divine names (like "LORD" or "God") are rendered in the target language

## Best practices

When selecting formatting options:

- **Start with defaults**: For your first draft, consider using the recommended default settings
- **Review sample output**: After generating a draft with specific settings, review the output to ensure it meets your needs
- **Maintain consistency**: Once you find settings that work well, use them consistently across your drafts
- **Consult your team**: Discuss formatting choices with your translation team to ensure they align with your project standards

## Getting help

If you're unsure which formatting options to select, or if you have questions about how specific options affect the draft output, you can:

- Contact the Scripture Forge support team for guidance
- Review sample drafts with different formatting options to see the differences
- Consult with your translation consultant or project manager

Remember that formatting options can be changed for future drafts, so you can adjust your selections as you learn what works best for your project.

## **Sign up for Auto Drafting** {#c01e77600a3b440ead3f1b816837d614}


To access Scripture Forge Auto Drafting, you will need to click on the “Generate Draft” button in the main menu. If it is your first time generating a draft in your project, you will be prompted to sign up for Translation Drafting and fill out the Translation Drafting form. You will see the “Sign-up for Drafting” button as shown in the image below.

After you fill out the form, please allow a couple days for the Scripture Forge onboarding team to review it and investigate the best settings for your project. Once this is done, the team will reach out to you with further instructions to guide you in the drafting process.


### **Selecting the Primary Reference Translation** {#26e1244e99c0459bad277d7cff4417b8}


To select or change your Primary Reference Translation, navigate to the “Settings” window. Here, under the Translate sub-section, you will find a drop-down menu that will display a list of resources. You can click here to select or change the reference translation for your project.


This will affect the whole project and anyone else who has access to it on Scripture Forge.


_**You cannot use Auto Drafting without selecting a Primary Reference Translation.**_

You also have the option to select the “Enable Translation Suggestions” checkbox right under this drop-down menu. This box enables suggestions for all users of the project. Please note that this is separate from Auto Drafting.


_**We recommend disabling Translation Suggestions if you plan to use Auto Drafting.**_


## **Translation Draft Generation Settings** {#4e17f4ac70274b9d8d615ad3d2679a82}


Once the Scripture Forge onboarding team has notified you that your project is ready for Auto Drafting, this section will appear under Settings. The Scripture Forge team will assist you with instructions for these settings as part of the onboarding process.

As shown in the image above, you will have a few options presented. You may choose to leave these unchecked if you do not wish to use them. Once you select a checkbox, use the dropdown list that appears to select your alternate source.


**1) Use a different source for Drafting checkbox**

- This will allow you to select a translation that will be used **in place of** the Primary Reference Translation to generate a draft.
- The alternate translation selected here must be the **same language** as the Primary Reference Translation.
- This translation will influence the style along with the lexical and exegetical content of the draft.

**2) Use a different source for Training checkbox**

- This will allow you to select a translation that will be used **in place of** the Primary Reference Translation to train the language model.
- The alternate translation selected here must be the **same language** as the Primary Reference Translation.
- This is a technical configuration that should only be set if instructed by the Scripture Forge team.

**3) Pre-translate headings and non-verse material checkbox** – We recommend you leave this box unchecked. Section headings will still be translated.


**4) Allow additional training data checkbox** – Selecting this checkbox will allow you to upload any further documents that can be used to train the language model. These files must contain parallel sentences in the same source and target languages as the Primary Reference Translation and the target project. Please note that you can **only upload .csv** files for this purpose.

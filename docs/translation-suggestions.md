## What are Translation Suggestions? {#5f721bd65922446f8eefb001acc89f30}


Translation suggestions allow for Scripture Forge to analyze a source and target language together, and automatically suggest words/phrases to use in the translation process.

- Translation suggestions are based on Scripture Forge analyzing verses in the target project that have already been translated from the source project.
- The more verses that you have in both the source and target, the better the suggestions will be.
- Suggestions work better with languages that are more similar, and do not work well with languages that are not related to each other.
- Before you start using translation suggestions, an administrator of the Paratext project must enable translation suggestions for your project.

## What is a Segment? {#3931f83c77104d27bfa1bcd797303914}


:::tip

Before doing translation work in Scripture Forge, you should understand what a ‚Äú**segment**‚Äù is.

:::




In Scripture Forge, a segment is a section of Scripture to be translated. This can be a section heading, a verse, or a part of a verse (like in poetry).


For example, the following passage has 6 segments (Title, Section Heading, Verse 1, etc): 


![](./2040717794.png)


In this next passage, there are 8 total segments (note: verse 23 has 6 segments):

## How to Use Translation Suggestions {#007fd10ab17d498ea44ffb913d92663f}


Now that you understand how to navigate in Scripture Forge, it‚Äôs time to learn how to use **translation suggestions**. Remember, translation suggestions are when Scripture Forge analyzes your translation work and automatically suggests words/phrases to use in the translation process.

1. In your project, go to the book and chapter that you want to translate.
1. Click in the segment that you want to translate.
1. Start typing your translation (right-hand side):

	![](./459991151.png)

	1. Note: Scripture Forge will save edits as you type.
1. As you type, suggestions may appear in a box below where you are typing:

	![](./607243211.png)

1. Next to the suggestions are a percentage:

	![](./1867382019.png)

	1. This indicates how confident the system is that this suggestion is correct. A higher percentage suggestion is more likely to be a higher quality suggestion.
1. If you want to use a suggestion, click on it or press **Enter** when that suggestion is highlighted.

	![](./1432167112.png)

1. This will insert that suggestion into the text:

	![](./153698692.png)

1. If you do not like a suggestion that was inserted into the text:
	1. Just delete or edit whatever words need to be changed.

		![](./788279187.png)

1. If none of the suggestions are good enough, you can ignore the suggestions and keep on translating.

### Continue Translating {#9e130c3ad9c048a4822e37e0d0ba0750}


:::tip

Scripture Forge will continue to learn and make better suggestions as you translate.

To adjust the _**translation suggestion settings**_ for your user, see the [steps here üîó](/translation-suggestions).

### Keyboard Shortcuts {#228a943ddd984192b78ae4ccb39c6211}

	![](./2095968269.png)

	1. Then press **Enter** to use the suggestion.
1. You can also press **CTRL + &lt;a number key&gt;** to insert that number of words for the highlighted suggestion.
	1. For example, if ‚ÄúCapernaum and they say‚Äù was highlighted:

		![](./907549995.png)

	2. Here is what the shortcut keys would insert:

		| Shortcut | Words inserted         |

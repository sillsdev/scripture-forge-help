When your draft is finished, Scripture Forge will indicate that it's ready and display the list of books that were drafted.

## Previewing a draft

The draft that Scripture Forge created will not be automatically imported to your project. You can preview the draft and then import a chapter or a book at a time into your project, or into a different project.

Click on a book to view the draft. The draft will open in a new tab on the editor page.
:::tip
To compare the draft to the text it was translated from, set a source on the settings page. This will allow you to see a source and the resulting draft side-by-side.

If you drafted a book the team has already finished translating, you can move the draft tab to the other side of the page, and compare it with the team's translation.

## Importing a single chapter

To import the draft of the current chapter into the project, click "Add to project". You can go to each chapter in the book and preview and import each chapter one at a time.

## Importing an entire book

If you want to import an entire book into the project, you can do this from the "Generate draft" page. Click the three-dot menu beside the book, and then select the option to import it to the current project, or to a different project.

In the dialog that opens, select the project you want the draft to be imported to. If the project hasn't been connected in Scripture Forge yet, you will need to connect it first. **Important:** Importing the draft will replace any existing content in the project for that book.

:::note
The project must already have the book you are importing. Make sure have already created the book in Paratext and synced it to Scripture Forge.

Once you've imported the draft to a project, sync the project in Scripture Forge and then do a send/receive in Paratext to see the changes.

## Exporting USFM files

If you prefer not to import the draft directly to your project, you can also download the draft as USFM files. On the "Generate draft" page, click "Download ZIP", and extract the files on your computer. You can then import these files into a project in Paratext.

## Viewing drafts in Paratext 10 Studio

Paratext 10 Studio directly integrates with Scripture Forge, and allows you to view a draft without importing it to a project. The Scripture Forge extension comes pre-installed, so all you need to do is log in to Scripture Forge in the extension, and then select your project to view the draft.

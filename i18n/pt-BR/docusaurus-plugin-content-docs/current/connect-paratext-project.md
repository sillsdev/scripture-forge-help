## Introdução {#6222bdf3db3a44b4bf01a9cc6ffdaa80}


:::tip

Paratext projects only need to be connected once within Scripture Forge.

:::




After a Paratext project is connected to Scripture Forge, every user that is a member of the project in Paratext (under User Permissions) will be able to open the project in Scripture Forge.


To be able to open a project in Scripture Forge, a user just needs to [login to Scripture Forge with their Paratext account information](/log-in).

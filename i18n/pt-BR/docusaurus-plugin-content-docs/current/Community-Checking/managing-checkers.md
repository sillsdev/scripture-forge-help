## Invite people to check your project {#678dca00aaa54fd79319ecf815049301}

Once you have the questions on your project, it’s time to invite community checkers.

In the side bar, click **Settings**, and scroll down to **Community Checking Settings**.

### User interaction settings {#84a006f1fbaa4c50a8ce8bac248c0e1d}

The first setting to consider is **Allow checkers to see each other's answers**. When community checkers are presented with a question, existing answers from other community checkers are not shown so that they will not influence the answer that is given. Once a question is answered, any other answers to the question will be shown, and checkers can comment on and like each other’s answers. If you don’t want this interaction and want answers from other checkers to always be hidden, turn off **Allow checkers to see each other's answers**.

### Sharing settings {#5aa7e3d8451f40cfa6b33c5dd39a3c6f}

If you want community checkers to be able to invite friends to the project, make sure **Allow users to invite others to the project** is enabled. If this setting is off, only project admins will be able to add community checkers to the project.

If you turn this setting on, there are two sharing modes to choose from. If you select **Anyone with a link**, you can send people a link to the project, and anyone who clicks the link can join the project. This is ideal if you want to invite a group of people (for example, you could share the link in a Facebook or WhatsApp group). Anyone with the link will be able to send the link to anyone else to join the project. Alternatively you can select **Email invitations only**, and community checkers will only be able to invite friends by sending an invitation in Scripture Forge (Scripture Forge will send an email invitation to the person).

In the side bar, click **Users**, and you will be presented with sharing options.

If you enabled link sharing in the previous step, there will be a link that you can copy to share the project. To copy the link, click the copy icon on the right side of the link.

If link sharing is turned off, or if you want to send email invitations to users, type the email of the user you want to invite, select the **Community Checker** role, and choose an invitation language. Then click **Send**. An email with a link will be sent to the person, who will need to click the link and sign up to join the project.
